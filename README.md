# Starter AngularJS Project with Webpack (Javascript)

This is a basic starter template for an AngularJS project using Webpack 2. There are a few sample components and directives to get started. This project is the culmination of watching a couple YouTube tutorials and reading through a bunch of random internet tutorials. The directives and components I have provided are broken up into controller and component/directive variables. 

Though I have provided no filters or services yet, their folder index.js's are linked up.

## To initialize this project: 
```
npm install
```
## To run this project in development mode with changes updated live
```
npm run dev
```
## To build to the dist folder for publishing
```
npm run prod
```
